# WPFluent

Expressive query syntax and utility libraries for WordPress. This was originally forked from [Expresser](https://github.com/expresser/expresser), a project developed by Storyware co-founder [Graham Blevins](http://grhm.me/). This project aims to bring a Laravel flavor to WordPress.

This project is meant to be used with the [3.0 version](https://framework.themosis.com/docs/2.0/) of the [Themosis Framework](https://framework.themosis.com/).
